  Valid targets:

    mega (default)

      Covers the popular Atmel chips on Arduino boards listed below, and many more.
      This is the primary target and all features will be included. Default setting.

      Chips:  ATmega328p, ATmega32u4, ATmega1280, ATmega2560
      Boards: UNO, Nano, Mini, Ethernet
              Leonardo, Micro, Esplora, Leonardo ETH
              Mega 1280, Mega 2560, Mega ADK
              Most Lilypads (excluding ones with an ATmega168)

    core

      This includes only the core feature set of dino:
        Set Pin Mode
        Digital Read/Write/Listen
        Analog Read/Write/Listen

      This is useful if you're getting errors when trying to upload, want to
      include specific features by hand, trying to squeeze onto something with
      low memory, or testing a new chip. This is the smallest the dino sketch
      can get for now, and should be universally compatible.

    mega168

      This specifically targets the older ATmega168 chip used in early Arduinos.
      They have half the RAM and flash available, so we need to cut the sketch down.
      This option includes core functionality AND:
          Servo (6 maxmium), DHT, OneWire, IR Out, Tone, SPI, I2C

      Chips:  ATmega168
      Boards: Duemilanove, Diecimila, Pro, Pro Mini
              (Later versions of these may carry an ATmega328)

      Note: While you can generate this sketch using any communication type,
      it will only fit on the ATmega168 when generated for serial communication.
      There is not enough memory available for Wi-Fi or Ethernet. You can
      try the core target to tradeoff features for networking instead.

      You can also try to create a serial over Wi-Fi bridge with:
      https://github.com/jeelabs/esp-link, if you have an ESP8266 handy.

      Note: Aux message is always limited to 264 bytes or less for the ATmega168.
            Servo count is always limited to 6 (normally 12) for the ATmega168 chip.
            These limits apply regardless of using this build target, as long as
            a board with that chip is selected in the IDE.

    arm

      This is the same as mega, but omits libraries specifically known to be
      incompatible with the Atmel SAMD (ARM Cortex M0) chips. Use this when
      you need to load a sketch on the Arduino Due or similar boards.
      This option includes all features EXCEPT:
          Serial, Tone, IR Out, I2C

      Chips:  AT91SAM3X8E
      Boards: Due

  NOTE: While different targets include different libraries, you can manually
  control which libraries are included at compile time by editing DinoDefines.h.
  All the library files (even the unused ones) are copied to the destination sketch
  folder to enable this. Uncomment a corresponding #define in DinoDefines.h to
  include everything needed for that library. Comment it out to exclude the library.
